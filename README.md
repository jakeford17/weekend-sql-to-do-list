# SQL To-Do List
This project is a task managing app that uses the full stack. A user can add a task that is stored in the database--those tasks can be marked as complete (status changes in the database) or be deleted from the database. Completed tasks are highlighted in a darker color and are marked as complete on the DOM.

## Installation
* `npm install`
* `npm start` (view in `localhost:5000`)

## Technologies Used
SQL To-Do List used the following technologies: jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and CSS for styling.
